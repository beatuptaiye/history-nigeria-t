        <h2>Pre-Colonial Era</h2>
        <p>The history of Nigeria dates back thousands of years with the emergence of various indigenous societies and
            kingdoms such as the Nri Kingdom, the Benin Empire, and the Hausa city-states. These societies were known
            for their advanced political systems, trade networks, and cultural achievements.</p>
        <p>This period spans thousands of years before the arrival of European colonial powers in the late 19th century.
            Here are some key aspects of precolonial Nigeria:</p>
        <Details>
            <summary><strong>Ancient Civilizations:</strong></summary>
            Nigeria has a long history of ancient civilizations, with some of the earliest known being the Nok
            civilization (circa 500 BCE to 200 CE). The Nok people are renowned for their terracotta sculptures
            and were located in what is now central Nigeria.
        </Details>
        <details>
            <summary><strong>City-States and Kingdoms:</strong></summary>
            As time progressed, various city-states and kingdoms emerged across the different regions of Nigeria.
            Notable among these were the Kingdom of Ife, the Kingdom of Benin, the Kanem-Bornu Empire, and the
            Hausa city-states. These societies had sophisticated political systems, artistic achievements, and
            economic structures.
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary><strong>Trade and Commerce:</strong></summary>
            Nigeria was a significant hub for trade, both within the African continent and beyond. Trans-Saharan
            trade routes connected Nigeria to North Africa, while coastal regions engaged in trade with
            Europeans long before the colonial period.
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary><strong>Religions and Beliefs:</strong></summary>
            Precolonial Nigeria was characterized by diverse religious beliefs. Indigenous African religions were
            predominant, with various deities and spirits being worshipped. Islam also gained a foothold in some
            regions, especially in the northern parts of Nigeria, through trade and cultural exchanges.
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary><strong>Art and Culture:</strong></summary>
            The precolonial period in Nigeria witnessed the flourishing of art and culture. The Kingdom of Benin,
            for example, is renowned for its intricate bronze and brass sculptures. The Ife people produced
            remarkable terracotta and bronze art, showcasing advanced artistic skills.
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary><strong>Social Organization:</strong></summary>
            Societal structures varied across regions. Some societies were organized into centralized monarchies,
            while others had decentralized systems with council-based governance. The Igbo people, for instance,
            had a decentralized political structure with village councils and a council of elders.
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary><strong>Colonial Influence:</strong></summary>
            The arrival of European powers, particularly the British, in the late 19th century, marked the
            beginning of colonial rule. Nigeria was amalgamated as a British protectorate in 1914, bringing an
            end to the precolonial era.
            <br>
        </details>
        <p>
            Understanding precolonial Nigeria is crucial for comprehending the complexity and diversity of
            the nation's cultures and societies before the significant disruptions caused by colonialism. The
            legacy of this period continues to shape contemporary Nigerian society
